  This project focuses on developing RoBin's autonomous navigation system for effective traversal within the Technion Kislak Park, a crucial  step towards its role as a park-cleaning robot. We have designed a comprehensive navigation program that orchestrates real-time tasks right from the initiation of RoBin's journey.
